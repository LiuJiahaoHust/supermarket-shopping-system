- supermarket shopping system based on borland C

This is my first project using c language, with more than 5,500 lines of code.In this project, we are not allowed to use any library except C standard library from Borland C.
Unfortunately, Borland C is a outdated platform and provide poor graphics library, which offer only 16 colors to design graphical interfaces.So I finish a graphics library with Int86 interrupt and use it to design GUi. 
Information is saved in files and managed by list.
